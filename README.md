# Loan Approval Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts loan approval outcomes using Python, scikit-learn, and data analysis techniques.

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant information. The model is trained on historical loan data and uses various features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and demographic information.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Multiple ML algorithms comparison
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics and visualization
